# Stock_Price_Alert

This is a flask web application that allows users to receive notifications when
the price of a given stock reaches a certain threshold. The application also allow users to
enter a stock ticker symbol and a price threshold, and sends a notification (e.g. an email
or a text message) to the user when the stock's price reaches or exceeds the threshold.
